# Web3-Event-Extractor

**Web3-Event-Extractor** is a project that extracts blockchain events and stores them in a database. It consists of both backend and frontend components.

## Backend

The backend component of this project handles the interaction with the blockchain, event decoding, data processing, and storage in a database.

### Blockchain Interaction

The backend connects to the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) blockchain using the Web3.js library. It establishes a connection to the BSC node to retrieve blockchain data.

```javascript
const web3 = new Web3('https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org/');
```

### Event Decoding

After fetching blockchain events, the backend decodes raw event data using the contract's ABI (Application Binary Interface). This process transforms the raw data into meaningful information, allowing us to extract details such as transaction amounts, sender and receiver addresses, and event types.

```javascript
const decoded = web3.eth.abi.decodeLog(abi, raw_log_data, raw_log_topics.slice(1));
```

### Data Processing

The backend processes the decoded event data to calculate relevant metrics. For instance, it calculates transaction amounts, rankings based on transaction volumes, and referrals associated with user addresses.

```javascript
decodedItems.forEach(tx => {
    // Calculate transaction amounts, rankings, and referrals
    // ...
});
```

### Database Storage

Processed data is then stored in a database. The backend uses SQL queries to insert and update data in the database tables.

```javascript
await db.Weeklys.create({
    address: add,
    amount: price,
    rank: i + 1
});
```

## Frontend

The frontend component provides a user interface for visualizing the extracted blockchain data and interacting with the system.

### Leaderboard Display

One of the key features of the frontend is the display of a leaderboard. This leaderboard showcases the top users based on transaction amounts, referral counts, and associated bonuses. Users can quickly see who the leading participants are.

```javascript
// Fetch leaderboard data from the backend API
fetch('backend-api/leaderboard')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        // Display data in a leaderboard format
    });
```

### User Interface

The frontend offers a user-friendly interface that allows users to explore the blockchain data visually. Interactive elements, charts, and graphs can be added to enhance user engagement and understanding.

```javascript
// Implement interactive elements for user engagement
// ...
```

## Getting Started

To get started with the **Web3-Event-Extractor** project, follow these steps:

1. **Backend Setup**:
   - Install backend dependencies: `npm install`
   - Configure environment variables in the `.env` file.
   - Run the backend server: `npm run start`

2. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd frontend`
   - Install frontend dependencies: `npm install`
   - Customize the frontend UI and appearance.
   - Run the frontend application: `npm run start`

3. **Connect Backend and Frontend**:
   - Ensure that the frontend fetches data from the backend API endpoints.

For comprehensive setup instructions and additional information, refer to the project's documentation.

## Conclusion

**Web3-Event-Extractor** seamlessly combines blockchain interaction, event decoding, data processing, and visualization in one coherent system. The backend manages the complex blockchain-related tasks, while the frontend provides an intuitive interface for users to explore and understand the extracted blockchain event data. This project is a valuable tool for scenarios requiring in-depth blockchain event tracking and analysis.
